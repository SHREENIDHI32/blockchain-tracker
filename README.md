# 🚀 Blockchain-Based To-Do List 🚀

Welcome to our **Blockchain-Based To-Do List** app! This is a revolutionary way to manage your tasks with the power of blockchain technology. 🌟

## What’s Inside? 🤔

This app combines a classic to-do list with cutting-edge blockchain features. Each task you add is securely recorded as a block in our mock blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. 

### Features:

- 📝 **Add Tasks**: Enter your tasks and hit "Add Task" to secure them on our blockchain.
- 🔒 **Secure Tracking**: Each task is hashed and linked to the previous task, just like a real blockchain!
- ⏱️ **Timestamped Entries**: Every task has a timestamp, so you know exactly when it was added.
